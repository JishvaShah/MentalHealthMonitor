**Project Objectives:**

The primary goal of the Mental Health Monitor is to provide users with a handy tool for assessing and monitoring their mental health (for example, anxiety and depression levels). It aims to offer a user-friendly and secure platform for individuals to gain insights into their mental well-being, track changes, and thus be able to make informed decisions about their mental health.
